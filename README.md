# Final Project
Class: CS 473 - Advanced Algorithms 
Last Modified: 11/1/2022

## Overview
The goal of the final project is to give you a chance to explore and apply an advanced algorithm to a real world problem. Advanced algorithm analysis forms much of the theoretical foundation of computer science.  Rather than require a comprehensive final exam, we would rather see you use your analytical and critical thinking abilities expressed towards accomplishing a goal of a producing a software product that implements something you are at least somewhat interested in. This document will outline the minimum basic expectations for the project and how you should implement and deliver that project, but you are encouraged to go above and beyond the minimum expectations.

### General Requirements
Overall this final project will contribute 30% of your overall grade for this class.  
* As a group you must choose and implement an advanced algorithm and apply it to a real world problem.
* You must compare the empirical (i.e. measured) efficiency of the algorithm to the theoretical efficiency of the algorithm you select. You must also use the __empirical doubling method__ as discussed in class.
* Your group must also prepare and present a final group project presentation to the class during the final exam period.
* You are highly encouraged (but not required) to find a __real world__ client with an actual, practical, algorithmic problem that actually needs solving. 
* Your group can still do very well on the final project an actual client, however, those groups that show creativity, initiative, and effort beyond the requirements of this course will benefit. 
* IMPORTANT: If you believe your group might wish to have Whitworth University as a client (as opposed to an individual professor), please first discuss this with me and do not approach __computing services__ directly. They have too much to worry about without fielding a lot of final project requests. If we decide your project rises to the level that the University be involved, I will represent Whitworth for you on your project.
* You may either design a new algorithm of your own choosing or you may pick an algorithm from the literature that we have NOT yet discussed in class.
  

### Group Project Structure and Professionalism
Groups will be assigned for this final project. Thus professional conduct when interacting with others will be important. If there are specific reasons you cannot participate in a group, you will be given a chance to state this when we collect group preference data for assigning the groups.

Desirable group behaviors are:
* Following through on scheduled meetings (or texting/emailing if there is an emergency and a meeting can't be attended on time)
* Practicing good listening skills and diplomacy when discussing issues or problems with the code. Instead of pointing blame, focus on fixing issues.
* Treating your group partner(s) the way you wish to be treated. 

In addition, since this project will be completed as a group, all code should be written utilizing pair programming, this means that:
* All group members will be present (preferably in person) and actively engaged when working on the code together. 
* Design and document the algorithm(s) with pseudo-code as a group before coding. 
* The group should all be present for coding. 
* Group members should take turns coding and directing.
* The rest of the work may be divided among the group members however, all group members should review all work before submitting it.
* Reliability in attending meetings and participation will all be a part of your final grade for this project. 
  
All documents, with the exception of the individual feedback sent via email, will be submitted via Whitgit. You and your partner have access to a group project folder. The most recent "active" main branch will be the branch of your project that is graded.

### Project Description and Ideas
You must not simply follow an online tutorial or submit existing projects found online as your own code. You may look at resources for ideas, you may use other libraries, but, the main design and coding of the algorithm for your project should be original work, designed, created and coded by the group as a whole. 

Here are some ideas

* Non Profit Delivery Application: Use a map interface to select delivery points. Compute the optimal route to those points.
* Other application for a client of your choosing that requires an efficient optimization algorithm.
* Optimization algorithm with easy to use interface for delivery of students on C.B.D.
* Bioinformatics algorithm implementation - (many possibilities here: alignment, DNA assembly, etc.).
* Computational Geometry: Delaunay triangulation, Voronoi diagram, etc. algorithm implementation.
* Boolean satisfiability algorithm â€“ write a SAT solver describe how it works compare it to other SAT solvers
* Numerical Analysis Algorithms (iterative row improvement, etc.)
* Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm implementation. Use your algorithm to find the frequency decomposition of actual sound clips.
* Other selected advanced algorithms topics or clients of your choice that were not covered in class.

### Deliverable #1: Paragraph Project Proposal Due Wed Nov 16
Please push your Paragraph Proposal to your Whitgit Folder for your project group.

I highly encourage each group to make a short project proposal to your instructor before you proceed. You don't want to be that group which at presentation time finds that their project was not sufficient!  Take the time to communicate with your instructor and determine if the level of difficulty is acceptable. Write up the project paragraph. Discuss this with your instructor before or on the due date. This paragraph can eventually become a part of your projects Readme.md file.

### Deliverable #2: Final Project Code and Readme.md Documentation File Due at the Final in the Groups Assigned Whitgit Repository
Your group will submit a Readme.md file along with your with all the code for your project to your shared Whitgit final project repository. This Readme.md file will contain
* The title of your final project program.
* A short description of the purpose and goals of the program, and a description of the algorithmic approach used to solve the problem. 
* Documentation on how to run the program.
* What assumptions did you make when working on the project (e.g. knowledge level of users, etc.)?
* A detailed pseudo-code design for the algorithm. 
* The documentation for this project is worth 6% of your overall grade for the course so make it representative of that weight. A single page document will likely not be detailed enough.
* Your code must be appropriately commented. This includes headers for every method/function and file headers.
* __Works Cited__ This should includes any third party libraries used, any online sources and any code utilized that was not specifically written for this project. These citations should also be listed directly in your code.

### Deliverable #3: Final Presentation at the Final 
During the final time for your section, your group will give a presentation on the work that you accomplished. 
* If your team wants to present early (i.e. on Monday of Finals week) you may. Please confirm with your instructor.
* Your team must give a talk describing your algorithm. Time allotted to each group will be determined by an even division of 2 hours / (# of groups + 1).
* You must demonstrate your algorithm running.
* You must present an __algorithm analysis__ of the worst case run time for your algorithm and compare this analytical runtime to the actual empirical runtime results using the period doubling method as described in class.

### Deliverable #4: Individual Project Reflection (Microsoft Forms Link Will be Provided)
Each group (at the start of the project) will make a group contract, which, will be evaluated by a Microsoft Forms link provided. 

The questions on the form will be reflective in nature and likely very similar to these shown here:
* What group were you with?
* Please rate how well you feel your group worked together (1 star - O=Poorly 3-Average 5-Excellent) 
* Please rate how well you worked at contributing to the group as a whole.
* Do you feel like your ideas were listened to by other group members?
* Did group members treat each other professionally and with respect?
* Were you able to contribute at the level you wanted to, and if not, what ideas do you have to ensure that you will be able to contribute to future group projects?
* Did all the group members in the group hold up their end of the individual group contract?
* Did you and your team made good team decisions, or did your or other team members make major decisions without first talking to the team as a whole?
* Did you and your team members shown passion/interest/enthusiasm for what you are building?
* What should you and your team keep doing well in the future?
* If there were issues, what improvements can you and your team make in the future to avoid them?
* Anything else you want to communicate?
