# This file does the graph coloring using breadth first search for our project
from course import *

#BUDGETED COLORING -> possible solution:
#1. Use breadth first search and prioritize coloring of higher-degree neighbors.
#2. in coloring, we can know minimum number of necessary time slots based on # classes & # rooms 
#   -> x classes / y rooms = z timeslots (minimum number of timeslots).
#3. create a list of numbers that is length of z, with indeces being timeslots and 
#   values being number of rooms currently used in that timeslot. 
#4. increment value of list for timeslot with the least number of rooms used...
#   e.g. initially 4 timeslots [0 0 0 0] -> [1 0 0 0] -> ... -> 
#   [1 1 1 0] (in this one, choose last index) -> [1 1 1 1] -> etc



#assigns the course to a room based on the room assignments of other classes (basically greedy coloring)
#inputs - current course class that doesn't have a room assigned, number of rooms available, 
#         number of rooms available in total as an integer, and a list of neighbors to the course
#outputs - no return values but sets the room value of the current course (colors it)
#worst case: O(n + v) where n is number of time slots v is num verts, avg case: O(n)
# XXXXXXXaverage time complexity: O(V), where V is the # of adjacent vertices worse case is O(V^2)

# create_graph_coloring_greedy function - colors a graph using a greedy algorithm. uses https://iq.opengenus.org/graph-colouring-greedy-algorithm/ as a reference
# input: an dictionary adjacency list representation of a graph, where the vertices are classes and edges are incompatibilities. 
#        e.g. c1---c2 means c1 and c2 can't be at the same time
#        input graph will just be a list of course objects, which have a member variable
#           that contains all neighbors
#        later we can implement stuff like time slots available and rooms available
# output: returns a set of Courses, with all items having the color assigned using graph
#           coloring methods.
